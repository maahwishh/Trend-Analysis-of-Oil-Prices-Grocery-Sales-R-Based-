# Trend Analysis of Oil Prices Grocery Sales (R-Based)
evaluated multiple forecasting models to predict key sales trends for Ecuadorian retail data from 2013 to 2017. Various statistical and machine learning approaches, including ARIMA, Prophet, TBATS, Random Forest, and GARCH(1,1), were employed and assessed for their accuracy using key metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. Random Forest consistently outperformed other models with the lowest RMSE (67.9), demonstrating its capability to handle non-linear patterns and complex relationships in the data. ARIMA and Prophet delivered moderate performance, balancing simplicity with predictive accuracy. GARCH(1,1), optimized for modeling volatility, exhibited poor forecasting performance, emphasizing its unsuitability for this dataset. For accurate sales forecasting, Random Forest is the most reliable choice, offering superior predictive power compared to traditional statistical methods and volatility-based models. This insight is crucial for decision-makers to optimize inventory management, promotional strategies, and operational planning in Ecuador&#39;s retail sector.
